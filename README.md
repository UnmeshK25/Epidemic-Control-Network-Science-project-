# Epidemic-Control-Network-Science-project-
Epidemic_simulator.py is a simulator developed to analyze the disease spreading across network and to control epidemic and spreading of disease using different strategies.The goal of this simulation is to test edge-based strategies : ‘Betweenness centrality’, ‘clustering’, ‘random’, ‘hub shutdown’ and ‘Jaccard coefficient’ for the airport network. Here mainly two functionality of the simulator: 1. Simulating spreading of disease and controlling it by removing edges in network (cancelling flights between airports) or nodes (airports) based on above strategies until vaccination is done and nodes (airports) recovered. 2. Compare the results and performance of these strategies.
